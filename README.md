# School_District_Analysis

# Pandas Project


## Overview of Project
   
   
   **On this project, we collaborated with Maria, the chief data scientist from the city school system responsible for analyzing information in many formats. Maria's task is to prepare all standardized test data for analysis, reporting, and presentations to provide feedback and insights about performance trends and patterns. Ultimately, these insights are used to make discussions and important decisions at the school and district level.**



### Purpose
   
   
   **The purpose of this work is to report the data analyzed and help Maria analyze data on student funding and students' standardized SAT scores. The school board has notified us that our file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically on reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth-graders appear to have been altered While utilizing the access given by the city school system to every student's math and reading scores as well as various information about the school they attend; our task is to aggregate the data and showcase trends in school performance. This analysis would help the school board and superintendent in deciding on the school budget and priorities while maintaining and high level of confidentiality to protect the students that we are reporting on.**


## Analysis 
   
   
   **First, one of the most important steps is to clean de data so that all-out analysis comes with detailed and understandable results. Also, after having studied and observed our data, I realized that there were some discrepancies from the academic dishonesty results of 9 grades at Thomas high school. Therefore, it was decided to implement their math and reading scores with NaNs function in our code and keep the rest of the data intact; also the was shown in our analysis an extensive list of unique prefixes and suffixes from the names, such as Mr,Mrs, Ms, Miss, MD , PH.d , etc.. so we realized a function in our code to delete those prefix and make our data cleaner.**    

## Results


-	Changes in our new updated findings based on our district summary analysis.
  
  
  
  
  **There was a slight change in our new district findings, after understanding the effect of academic dishonesty from the 9th grades at Thomas High school made their overall score go down by a low rate; therefore, our analysis's results imply that I general these new changes did not affect our research significantly because just a tiny quantity of students had their scores altered.**

-	What does the new school summary represent?


**The most significant change represented in our new findings on the new high school summary at Thomas high school has shown the notable increase in % Passing Math students from 66.91% to 93.18% , also the % Passing Reading score from an old average of 69.66% to 97.01% and the final % Overall Passing 65.07% to 90.63%. ( the percentage of passing students increased up to 90% while the rest of the students at Thomas high School had performed above the passing grade.**

-	What was the effect of replacing math and reading scores from Thomas High School's students compared to other schools?


**When comparing Thomas High School to other schools, we can conclude that replacing the 9th graders' results from Thomas High School became much better for their average school performance and, as a result, made Thomas High the top three best overall Performance in the district.**

-	**Regarding the math and reading score by grade, our new finding based on our detailed analysis report did not indicate any change in the results obtained; there were minor errors for the ninth graders at Thomas High School; however, the rest of the data was in perfect conditions.**



-	**When analyzing our new findings on "scores by school spending, "there was no effect from our new findings that could influence any discrepancies in our data. These results are categorized by the budget per student, which means the amount of money invested by the school.**

-	**In similarity to our "scores by school spending, "the scores by school size did not show any relevant changes on our data; the data was immaculate and formatted in a proper way.**

-	**In the last part of our detailed analysis, we conclude that there was not any significant change in our data from "Scores by school type" This is because Thomas High School was categorized as a whole. The ninth graders represent such a small portion of the whole school concerning the rest of the other high schools.**

 ### Summary


-	What are the advantages of using python with pandas for future analysis and in our findings?


**This report is a detailed representation that demonstrates that using python with pandas for the analysis of the data from the school district show that replacing the ninth graders' scores at Thomas High School got as a result of small change on the district analysis from one side and by contrast reflected a relevant change in the per school summary the made Thomas High School be on the top tree school in the district with one of the best % overall performance. This analysis indicated the positive feedback and results when using NaNs function to clean and simplified our findings.**
